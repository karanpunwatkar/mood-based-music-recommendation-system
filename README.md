# Mood-Based Music Recommendation System

## Problem Statement

Since our lives are now hectic, music is really a way of communicating or better still, one's feelings and the controlling of those emotions. Thus, the large numbers of songs today make it not easy to find a tune to suit your mood anytime. Knowing immediately the songs that correspond with your emotional state whenever you are high-spirited, melancholic, relaxed, or energized will be significantly beneficial to your listening time.

Most of the existing music recommendation algorithms are focused on usage of listening history but very much neglect that the best of the emotional and moods aspects also have something to do with the person. People sometimes don't listen to something they may have played before; maybe they just need to hear something that they can equate with the mood right now.

## Solution Overview

To mitigate this problem, we built the **Mood-Based Music Recommendation System. This app lets users determine his or her mood between some of the options offered that include happy, sad, relaxed, or energetic. When the user selects any particular mood, the app, randomly provides a song that fits the chosen particular mood and automatically opens a tab with the song through a browser for listening right away without any further notice.

This user-friendly interface helps one find their kind of music that conveys emotions one feels. A system of songs with a range of Hindi, English, and Marathi lists curated will attempt to create different experiences that fit various emotional needs of the listeners.

### Key Features:
- **Mood Select**: There are several moods to choose from.
- **Song Recommendations**: Get instant recommendations for songs that fit the mood you have selected.
- **Direct Playback**: Listen to your chosen track right in your browser.

We strive to make this project so that everyone will find the perfect soundtrack for their emotions, thereby strengthening the bond between music and mood.
